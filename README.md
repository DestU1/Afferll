# Afferll Game Engine
A personal project of mine to learn, experience and get a better understanding of:
- Version control systems (git)
- Large scale and multi-part projects
- Graphics programming
- C++ application architectures
- Game engines as a whole

Inpired by The Cherno and his game engine series
